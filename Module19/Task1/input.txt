Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been many statements, 
yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the story from 
my father, who also had it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it 
occurred even as is here set forth. And I would have you believe, my sons, that 
the same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it, and that 
no ban is so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed. Learn then 
from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to be circumspect 
in the future, that those foul passions whereby our family has suffered so 
grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing.
